global-chrome-tab
=================

Chrome extension for opening a new tab or window with a global shortcut.

This is very handy, as evidenced by the fact that Chromebooks have a dedicated Search button.

To use, install the extension and in the keyboard shortcuts section at the bottom, set a shortcut for the new tab or new window action and make it Global.

If you use incognito window, you need to check "Allow in incognito" checkbox of the extension.
